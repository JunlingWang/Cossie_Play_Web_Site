            Cosplay, a portmanteau  of the words costume play, is a performance art in which participants called  cosplayers wear costumes and fashion accessories to represent a specific  character. Cosplayers often interact to create a subculture and a broader use  of the term &quot;cosplay&quot; applies to any costumed role-playing in venues  apart from the stage. Any entity that lends itself to dramatic interpretation  may be taken up as a subject and it is not unusual to see genders switched.  Favorite sources include manga and anime, comic books and cartoons, video  games, and live-action films and television series.
